plotlyutils
===========

This package contains some utility functions and htmlwidgets for
[plotly](https://plot.ly/), and a related talk (see vignettes and the
[package site](https://alanocallaghan.github.io/plotlyvignettes/) (built
with [pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown)).

Given the interactive nature of the plots in this package, it is much
more useful to look at [the pkgdown site for this
package](https://alanocallaghan.github.io/plotlyvignettes/).
